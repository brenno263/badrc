# Badrc

`Badrc` is a program which messes up your shell environment. I won't tell you how yet - you'll find out...

Don't worry though! It's only temporary! Once you close your shell everything will return to normal. Just don't append this stuff to your .bashrc - that could cause some real issues.

## Requirements
You'll need to be using `zsh` with `python` installed.

## Running
When you're ready to have a bad time, simply source the shell script:
```bash
source badtime.sh
```
